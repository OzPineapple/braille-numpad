# Another braille translator

So I was thinking about this shitty projects where people use an arduino and some cheap digital keyboard to yell "inclusive"
but I don't think you are going to throw a protoboard to a blind person face and say "now you can use a computer!".
Also there is this blind person keyboard online you can buy (I think the ones with the braille feedback on the bottom are pretty cool)
with some weird shapes but if you are honest those are expensive and pretty weird to see.
A lot of nowadays keyboard have the numerical pad at the right side and it kinda looks like a braille input keyboard.

This is a proof of concept, if I don't get puer aeternus by this crap I will try to improve this.
I just hope that someone doesn't fork it before and make a better version so I'd look like an idiot.

The program prints braille unicode characters and the translation in ascii english alphabet.
Keys produce a sound with the pc beeper so you the program beep in order to work.

## Dependencies

https://github.com/spkr-beep/beep

## Instructions

- compile and run duh
- Put the number pad in _block number_
- The mapping for the braille keyboard is the next where the numbers represent the standard braille indexes,

**Normal usage**    **Braille mode**

- Press the dots and then enter zero to generate a braille character
- Press enter to translate the braille to english
- Press '-' key to stop the program

## TODO

- Read keys instead of char so no need to block number
- Send braille to bash input so you can actually use the dam computer
- Vocalize commands outputs
- Fix the dam utf8 in/out or even use latin-1… still thinking about it

# DONE

- Make a beep for each braille character (I think a synthetic voice is annoying 
- Map to ASCII braille

## PD

So that, idk… eat well and don't download League of legends
